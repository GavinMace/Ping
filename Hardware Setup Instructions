Turn on hardware
check bluetooth if it says paired then remove device and fiddle with it until it works because this tech is 20 years old and nobody uses this anymore
if not open mindwave tutorial and it should ask which port it is connected to (AUTO will not work in most cases)
Find the part in the code where it asks for COM port and put the correct one in because nothing is easy
